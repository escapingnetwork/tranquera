I'm excited to share with you the updated tech stack of Capybara House, a Tranquera service that we formally introduced on this platform 3 months ago and has been continuously evolving ever since.

Our Journey:

When Capybara House was first launched, it was an MVP with the minimum features required to provide services to our clients. However, this setup limited us in terms of scalability and the ability to extend the quality and features of our service.

Embracing iteration and continuous improvement from the start, we have been constantly working to enhance our technological infrastructure and deliver the best possible experience to our clients.

This is just the beginning!
