After a bit of radio silence, we’re excited to announce the launch of a Reviews feature on Capybara House! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

🗣️ We value the voices of our clients, and now both students and hosts—past and future—can share their experiences. This will be especially helpful for students looking to hear about their peers’ stays. Plus, all reviews are automatically translated into our supported languages for everyone to enjoy!

📨 In the coming days, we’ll be reaching out to clients who’ve already used our services to kick things off by sharing their stories. 

Visit us at [Capybara House](https://capybara.house) to check it out soon!

👀 In the meantime you can check out the review form, translations, and extended view in action below!

🪴 We’re starting simple but plan to improve the form over time for better metrics.

PS: This update also includes Italian 🇮🇹 and French 🇫🇷 Internationalization!
